= Hash Quality

:idprefix: hash_quality_

In order to work properly, hash tables require that the supplied hash function
be of __good quality__, roughly meaning that it uses its `std::size_t` output
space as uniformly as possible, much like a random number generator would do
—except, of course, that the value of a hash function is not random but strictly determined
by its input argument.

Closed-addressing containers in Boost.Unordered are fairly robust against
hash functions with less-than-ideal quality, but open-addressing and concurrent
containers are much more sensitive to this factor, and their performance can
degrade dramatically if the hash function is not appropriate. In general, if
you're using functions provided by or generated with link:../../../../container_hash/index.html[Boost.Hash^],
the quality will be adequate, but you have to be careful when using alternative
hash algorithms.

The rest of this section applies only to open-addressing and concurrent containers.

== Hash Post-mixing and the Avalanching Property

Even if your supplied hash function does not conform to the uniform behavior
required by open addressing, chances are that
the performance of Boost.Unordered containers will be acceptable, because the library
executes an internal __post-mixing__ step that improves the statistical
properties of the calculated hash values. This comes with an extra computational
cost; if you'd like to opt out of post-mixing, annotate your hash function as
follows:

[source,c++]
----
struct my_string_hash_function
{
  using is_avalanching = std::true_type; // instruct Boost.Unordered to not use post-mixing

  std::size_t operator()(const std::string& x) const
  {
    ...
  }
};
----

By setting the
`link:../../../../container_hash/doc/html/hash.html#ref_hash_is_avalanchinghash[hash_is_avalanching]`
trait, we inform Boost.Unordered
that `my_string_hash_function` is of sufficient quality to be used directly without
any post-mixing safety net. This comes at the risk of degraded performance in the
cases where the hash function is not as well-behaved as we've declared.

== Container Statistics

If we globally define the macro `BOOST_UNORDERED_ENABLE_STATS`, open-addressing and
concurrent containers will calculate some internal statistics directly correlated to the
quality of the hash function:

[source,c++]
----
#define BOOST_UNORDERED_ENABLE_STATS
#include <boost/unordered/unordered_map.hpp>

...

int main()
{
  boost::unordered_flat_map<std::string, int, my_string_hash> m;
  ... // use m

  auto stats = m.get_stats();
  ... // inspect stats
}
----

The `stats` object provides the following information:

                                    .deviation
                       .num_comparisons             // Elements compared per operation
			                           .average

                         .count                     // Number of operations
                         .probe_length              // Probe length per operation
                                      .average
                                      .variance
                                      .deviation

Statistics for three internal operations are maintained: insertions (without considering
the previous lookup to determine that the key is not present yet), successful lookups,
and unsuccessful lookups (including those issued internally when inserting elements).
_Probe length_ is  the number of
xref:structures.adoc#structures_open_addressing_containers[bucket groups] accessed per operation.
If the hash function behaves properly:

* Average probe lengths should be close to 1.0.
* The average number of comparisons per successful lookup should be close to 1.0 (that is,
just the element found is checked).
* The average number of comparisons per unsuccessful lookup should be close to 0.0.

An link:../../../benchmark/string_stats.cpp[example^] is provided that displays container
statistics for `boost::hash<std::string>`, an implementation of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash[FNV-1a hash^]
and two ill-behaved custom hash functions that have been incorrectly marked as avalanching:
